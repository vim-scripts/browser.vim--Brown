               This plugin opens a website by making a lynx -dump call behind
               the scenes and takes advantage of the dumps link references so
               you can click on links and browse through a site.

               It seems to work well on wikipedia and any text friendly sites
               when all you want is a quick definition to settle a factual debate... etc. 

               Included are some 'K' keywordprg modifications to give you some ideas. 
                (If you have any file type specific suggestions please email them to me)

               :WebBrowser www.vim.org
               To open a web page

               :Wikipedia the life of brian
               Will open en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<search term> 
               :Google <search term>
               Opens google to the search term

               :GoogleLucky <search term>
               Opens Lucky Google search 

               you can also create your own site specific googling eg.  
               com! -nargs=+ GooglePythonDoc call OpenGoogle(<q-args>, 0 , 'docs.python.org')
               (make the second arg 1 for lucky)
               
               Within the browser view the <tab> key cycles through links and
               pressing <cr> will open a link. 

               the u key seems to work ok as a back button
